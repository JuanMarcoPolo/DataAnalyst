# DataAnalyst
John Mark Dejeres' Data Analyst Portfolio. A collection of data analysis projects showcasing my skills in Excel, SQL, data visualization, Power BI, statistical analysis, and machine learning.
Projects include analysis of customer demographics, predictive modeling of product sales, and sentiment analysis of social media data. Visit my website for more details and examples of my work.


NOTE: These are sample project from REFOCUS which aims to enable us (students) to collaborate with other students in a group to come up with an analysis regarding the sample problem using what we've learned through the learning platform. Other than the Dashboard I've created, the sample data used in creating this dashboard is owned by REFOCUS and my group mates, and I am in no way taking credit of said sample data.
